# Prework - **codepath-ios101-prework**

Submitted by: **Steven Le**

**codepath-ios101-prework** is an app that changes the color of the background when clicking on a button. I also added in the functionality to view a random image when clicking on the button

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

I had a lot of challenges understanding Swift and implmementing my own features such as a randomize image. That took the longest time but was a lot of fun experimenting on my own! A pain point was understanding where all the buttons were located. In particular, the "Adjust Editor Options" was difficult for me to find. However, after looking up other YouTube videos for guides and working at it, I found the button and completed the tasks required. Swift Playground has some similar to Unity, which is something I'm similar with, so that was nice to see!

##My Unique Twist:
- Adding in a randomized image when clicking on the button!

##Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

## App Brainstorming
Favorite apps:
- IMessage: Text back instantly, saves photos to an easily accessible spot, ability to customize emojis
- Snapchat: Text back instantly, ability to know when the other person is on the same chat, and easily send photos
- Instagram: Ease of use, Text back instantly, view other's posts
- LinkedIn: Easy way to connect to others, ability to find others that work at the same job, ability to apply to jobs

## Possible new app idea I'd like to build
I think building an IOS app for the Vision Pro would be amazing during this course. With the new release of the Vision Pro XCode Beta, I want to start learning swift to build applications for it because I am also very interested in the XR industry. I'd like to make my IOS apps compatible for both IPhones and Vision Pro, and make an app that can benefit others, possibly implmeneting in API calls and calling Generative AI to help the user! I beleive this would be possible during the course, and I'd love to continue learning about this new lanuage!
