## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

I had a lot of challenges understanding Swift and where all the buttons were located. In particular, the "Adjust Editor Options" was difficult for me to find. However, after looking up other YouTube videos for guides and working at it, I found the button and completed the tasks required. Swift Playground has some similar to Unity, which is something I'm similar with, so that was nice to see!
